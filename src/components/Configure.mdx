# Component Library Configuration Guide

Welcome to the **Aman's Component Library** configuration guide. Here, you'll find everything needed to set up, use, and configure each component effectively.

## Installation

To begin using the component library, install it via npm or yarn:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install aman-component-library

# Using yarn
yarn add aman-component-library
```

## Usage

To use a component, import it into your project and pass the required props. For example:

```jsx
import { Checkbox } from 'aman-component-library';

const MyComponent = () => (
  <Checkbox checked={false} onChange={handleChange} onClick={handleClick} variant="primary" />
);
```

## Props

Each component has its own set of props that control its behavior and appearance. For a complete list of props and their descriptions, refer to the component's documentation.

## Theming
The component library supports theming through CSS variables. You can customize the appearance of the components by overriding the default CSS variables in your project's CSS file.
