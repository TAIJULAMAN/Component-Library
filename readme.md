An easy way to create a UI component for your web project.

Demo: [Demo](http://example.com/demo)


## Motivation

Most web projects consist of components. They can range from simple elements like buttons and form inputs to complex components like modals and tooltips. Any large project eventually becomes hard to manage and navigate if all components are not stored in a centralized location.

The Aman Component Library serves as a dedicated space to store and manage all the UI components of a web application, ensuring easy access and organization.

## Features

- Easy to install
- Easy to manage
- Easy to integrate with existing projects
- No conflicts with existing JavaScript and CSS

## Installation

To install the Aman Component Library, run:

```bash
npm install aman-component-library

## Setting Up Components

Create a folder in your project's file system and fill it with the required component files. You can structure your components in a way that best suits your application. For example, you can create separate folders for buttons, cards, inputs, etc.

/my-project
  └── /src
      └── /components
          ├── Button.js
          ├── Card.js
          ├── Input.js
          └── ...
